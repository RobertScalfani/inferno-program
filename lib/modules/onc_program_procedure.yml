          The health IT developer demonstrates the Health IT Module supports
          application registration with an authorization server for the purposes
          of Electronic Health Information (EHI) access for single patients,

          registration with an authorization server for the purposes of EHI
          access for single patients, including support for application

        inferno_supported: 'no'
        inferno_notes: |
          Application registration is currently out of scope for automated
          testing within Inferno Program Edition because there is no standard
          being required.
        alternate_test: |
          Prior to executing the single patient tests, the health IT developer
          must demonstrate the steps involved in registering Inferno as a client
          application using registration information provided within the Inferno
          interface (e.g. redirect url). During this process, the system under
          test developer provides a client ID, client secret, and a list of
          authorized scopes to Inferno.  By inputting this information into
          Inferno, the tester verifies that a new client application can be
          registered within the system under test. All tests within "Standalone
          Patient App", "Limited Scope App", and "EHR Practitioner App" must use
          clients registered at the time of testing.  Note that the "Standalone
          Patient App" and "EHR Practioner App" can use separate client
          registrations if necessary.

        inferno_supported: 'no'
        inferno_notes: |
          Application registration is considered out of scope for Inferno
          Program Edition because there are no requirements on how registration
          can occur.
        alternate_test: |
          Prior to executing the 'Multi-Patient Data Query' tests, the health IT
          developer must demonstrate the steps involved in registering Inferno
          as a bulk client application using the JWKS URL provided within the
          Inferno interface.  During this process, the health IT developer
          provides a backend serives token endpoint, a bulk client ID, and a
          list of authorized scopes for the application.  By inputting this
          information into Inferno, the tester verifies that a new client
          application can be registered within the system under test.
          Registering client applications using the JWKS URL is strongly
          recommended in the specification, but if this is not possible, the
          tester can provide the keys directly by manually visiting Inferno's
          JWKS URL and providing that to the health IT developer.

          Inferno tests that all endpoints provided support at least TLS
          version 1.2, and rejects all requests for TLS version 1.1 or below.
          This includes all FHIR endpoints (if more than one is provided), as
          well as authorization endpoints required by SMART. Inferno can be
          configured to disable TLS testing if configuring TLS within a
          lab environment is not possible.  Note that there are no SHALL
          requirements within the "FHIR Communications Security Requirements" in
          FHIR R4, and therefore there are no tests based on this requirement.

          It may be possible to use the Token Introspection standard to do this,
          if supported, though this is only a weak guarentee that the refresh token
          is valid for that length of time.
